#summary How to compile and install Toka
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Prerequisites =

You will need the following things to build Toka:
 * C compiler (tested against GCC 2.95, 3.x, and 4.x)
 * Standard C Library ("libc")
 * Library providing dlopen() and dlsym() (BSD: libc, Linux, BeOS: libdl)
 * Make (either BSD or GNU) or Rebuild (http://code.google.com/p/rebuild)

= Compiling =

As of March 5, 2007, Toka's build system tries to detect the host system automatically. For most people, the following should work:

{{{
  make
}}}


If this fails, try one of the following:

{{{
  make clean linux
}}}

Or:

{{{
  make clean bsd
}}}

= Installation =

In a default configuration, Toka will need to be installed if you want it to automatically load the _bootstrap.toka_ extensions. A default install puts _toka_ in _/usr/bin_ and the bootstrap + library modules in _/usr/share/toka_.

{{{
  make install
}}}


= Alternative: Using rebuild =

If you are using the rebuild tool, do the following:

{{{
  cd source
  rebuild toka
  cp toka /usr/bin
  cd ..
  mkdir -p /usr/share/toka
  cp bootstrap.toka /usr/share/toka
}}}

= Testing =

Toka has a small test suite included. To check your build against it, run:

{{{
  make tests
}}}
