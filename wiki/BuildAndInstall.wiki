#summary How to compile and install Toka
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Prerequisites =

You will need the following things to build Toka:
 * C compiler (tested against GCC 2.95, 3.x, and 4.x)
 * Standard C Library ("libc")
 * Library providing dlopen() and dlsym() (BSD: libc, Linux, BeOS: libdl)
 * Make (either BSD or GNU)

= Compiling =

{{{
  make clean linux
}}}

Or:

{{{
  make clean bsd
}}}

= Installation =

In a default configuration, Toka will need to be installed if you want it to automatically load the _bootstrap.toka_ extensions. A default install puts _toka_ in _/usr/bin_ and the bootstrap + library modules in _/usr/share/toka_.

{{{
  make install
}}}

= Testing =

Toka has a small test suite included. To check your build against it, run:

{{{
  make tests
}}}
