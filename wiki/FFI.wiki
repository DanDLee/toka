#summary Overview of the Foreign Function Interface

= The Foreign Function Interface =

Toka has a set of words to map in and allow use of external library functions. This is called the Foreign Function Interface, or FFI. This interface is primarily provided by two words. The first, *from*, is used to select a library to import functions from. 

{{{
 from libc.so
 from libgtk-2.0-x11.so
}}}

After setting the active library you can *import* functions from it: 

{{{
 from libc.so
 1 import puts
}}}

The *import* word takes the number of arguments and the name of the function to import. When you are ready to use the imported function, just invoke its name: 

{{{
 from libc.so
 1 import puts
 " hello, world!" puts
}}}

Imported functions will leave their return value on the stack.  

In addition to these words, the decompiler has also been extended to recognize FFI functions, displaying a form like: 

{{{
 [ address #args  ]
}}}
