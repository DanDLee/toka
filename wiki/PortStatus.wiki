 * The FFI may not function properly; it has not been fully tested.

== BeOS ==
 * _make install_ does not work
 * Requires libdl (http://bebits.com/app/2917)
 * May need GCC 3.x, rather than 2.9x (http://bebits.com/app/4011)

== MIPS ==
 * Only tested under GXemul (http://gavare.se/gxemul/). 
 * NetBSD/pmax: All functionality works as expected
 * Debian/pmax: All functionality works as expected.
