= Introduction =

Toka was intended to be easily portable across a wide variety of systems. This page lists each system tested thus far, and provides additional notes concerning limitations for specific ports at the end.

 * Linux
 * NetBSD
 * FreeBSD
 * OpenBSD
 * DragonFly BSD
 * Windows XP, Vista (via Cygwin)
 * BeOS

 * NetBSD


= Limitations =

== Windows ==

Toka can be built and used under Windows via Cygwin (see http://cygwin.com). It has not been tested on Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000, or NT. The library functionality does not work in most cases, since Windows lacks a standard libc. This may be addressed in a future release of Toka. 

== BSD ==

The library does not work in many cases as imports are done from libc.so.6. This will be addressed in a future release of Toka. (As a temporary solution, try creating a symlink in /lib to the real libc.so or change each of the library files).

== NetBSD/MIPS ==

Due to lack of real hardware, Toka was tested under GXemul (see http://gavare.se/gxemul/). All functionality works as expected.
