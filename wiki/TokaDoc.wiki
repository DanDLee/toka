= Introduction =

To help keep an up-to-date list of C functions and their Toka equivilents, the !TokaDoc scripts were developed. These seach C sources for specially formatted comments and extract them into various files. These files will be updated by _make docs_

= Supporting TokaDoc =

At the start of each C file, have a comment header like this:

{{{
 /*
  *|F|
  *|F| FILE: filename
  *|F|
  */
}}}


Before any global variables, have a comment block like this:

{{{
/*
 *|F| Variables:
 *|F|   GCITEM gc_list[128]
 *|F|   Holds the list of items marked as garbage.
 *|F|
 */
}}}


Before each function have a comment block like this:

{{{
 /*
  *|F| <return type> functioname(<arguments>)
  *|F| description of the function
  *|F|
  */
}}}


And for any functions having a Toka equivilent, have a block like:

{{{
 /*
  *|G| wordname    stack-effect    description
  */
}}}

Please try to keep columns lined up as much as possible for Toka wordlist comments.
