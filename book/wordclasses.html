<h1>&nbsp;WordClasses</h1>


<p>An implementation strategy adopted from HelFORTH. Each quote, primitive,
and data structure has a <i>class</i> assigned to it. These classes are
aware of the current compiler state (<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>), and may be
aware of other aspects of the Toka system as well.
</p>
<p>When an item is found, the corresponding <i>class handler</i> is invoked.
The primary classes you will encounter in Toka are:
</p>
<h3>is</h3>

<p>This is the most common class. 
</p>

<ul>
<li> Compiling: compile a call to the quote.
<li> Interpreting: invoke the quote.

</ul>

<h3>is-macro</h3>

<p>A special case, these are used for quotes that need to be invoked
whenever they are encountered. Macro class is used for creating strings
(via <b>"</b>) and symbolic creation of characters (via <b>char:</b>).
</p>

<ul>
<li> Compiling: invoke the quote.
<li> Interpreting: invoke the quote.

</ul>

<h3>is-data</h3>

<p>This is the second most common class. It is used for all data structures,
including variables, arrays, and strings.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Compiling: compile the value into the quote.
<li> Interpreting: leave the value on the stack.</ul>
