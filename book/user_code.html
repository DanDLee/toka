<h1>&nbsp;User Code</h1>


<p>Use this page to extend Notebook using the 
the Tcl language.  Commands you add here can be used as
Magic Buttons and Embedded Macros.
</p>
<p>Note that you can intersperse normal prose in between blocks of Tcl code.
</p>
<h2>User Menu</h2>

<p>The User Menu pops up when you right-click or control-click 
on a page in the Page Browser.  You can customize it however you like.
</p>
<pre>usermenu {
    Back back-page
    Home {goto-page Home}
}
</pre>

<h2>Edit Menu</h2>

<p>The Edit Menu pops up when you right-click or control-click 
on a page in the Page Editor.  You can customize it however you like.
</p>
<pre>editmenu {
    Undo             undo-change
    Redo             redo-change
    separator {}
    Cut              cut-string
    Copy             copy-string
    Paste            paste-string
    "Insert Page..." insert-page
}
</pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following embedded macro used to be used by the
<span style="color: red;">[Tour]</span> to create a magic button that said 
"Click here to continue..." and took you to the next page in the tour
when you clicked it.  It's no longer needed, because now you can write
such links directly, like this:
</p>
<pre>  [Click here to continue...|Tour 2]
</pre>

<p>Still, it's a nice example of how to write a macro that creates a button.
</p>
<pre>proc clickToContinue {name} {
	return "\[%Click here to continue...|goto-page [list $name]%\]"
}
</pre>
