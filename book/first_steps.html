<h1>First Steps</h1>

<p>At present, Toka provides a basic <i>listener</i> as the only interface.
This is a console-based enviroment where you can type commands and get
instant feedback. Let's get started:
</p>
<pre>  crc@strider: toka
</pre>

<p>If you built and installed Toka properly, it should start, displaying a
message like:
</p>
<pre>  toka (svn build)
</pre>

<p>At this point, you can begin entering code. Let's start by exploring the
enviroment a little:
</p>
<pre>  :names
</pre>

<p>Invoking <b>:names</b> will display all named elements in the currently
running Toka. Don't panic at the number of items -- you only need to
learn a handful of them to write code in Toka.  The list is divided into
several groups:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Primitives, the building blocks everything else is based on
<li> Quotes, everything in the <i>bootstrap.toka</i> and any code you write
<li> Data, for variables, arrays, and other data structures

</ul>

<p>Now let's delve into actually using Toka a bit.
</p>
<h4>Introductory Bits</h4>

<ul>
<li> The Stack
<li> Basic Math

</ul>

<h4>Intermediate Exploration</h4>

<ul>
<li> Quotes
<li> Loops
<li> Conditionals

</ul>

<h4>Data Structures</h4>

<ul>
<li> Types
<li> Variables
<li> Arrays

</ul>

<h4>Interfacing with the World</h4>

<ul>
<li> Files
<li> FFI
<li> Scripts
<li> Libraries
</ul>
