<h1>&nbsp;Types</h1>


<p>Toka has one data type, called the <i>cell</i>. This is a machine
dependent sized memory area that can hold a single number or pointer. On
32-bit systems, cells are 4 bytes in length, and on 64-bit systems, they
take 8 bytes. A constant, <b>cell-size</b>, returns the exact length
provided by Toka on your system.
</p>
<p>Cells can hold numbers, pointers to allocated memory, and pointers to
quotes. When Toka encounters a number or a pointer, it is placed on the
stack. For more permanent storage, you can store cell values into memory
locations for later use. 
</p>
<p>This is where a number of abstractions arise. Memory allocated for
storage of values is called <a href="variables.html">variables</a>. Memory allocated for sequences
of values are called <a href="arrays.html">arrays</a>. And a special class of array is used for
sequences of characters. These are called <a href="strings.html">strings</a>.
</p>
<p>In all of these, when you reference them, a <i>pointer</i> is left on the
stack. Pointers are simply numbers corresponding to an actual memory
address. <i>It is up to you to know what abstract data type a pointer
represents</i>.
</p>
<p>When dealing with variables, you can use <b>@</b> (fetch) and <b>!</b>
(store) to set and obtain the values stored in them. If you need to fetch
or store single characters (as may arise when manipulating strings), you
can use <b>c@</b> and <b>c!</b> instead.
</p>
<p>Arrays have an entire abstracted set of words for dealing with them. It's
well worth learning to use these, as they are portable, and make
accessing and setting individual elements in an array trivial.
</p>
<h4>Tips</h4>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to use <b>cell-size</b> and <b>char-size</b>
instead of hard coding the sizes for data. This helps ensure readability
and portability.</p>
