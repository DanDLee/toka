<h1>&nbsp;Quotes</h1>


<p>With the functions described above, many small programs can be written.
Toka has much more functionality, but before proceeding further, we need
to take a look at how to create new functions (called <i>quotes</i>).
</p>
<p>In Toka, a <i>quote</i> is the basic building block. At the simplest
level, they are anonymous blocks of code and data. Quotes are created by
encolsing the code and/or data in brackets:
</p>
<pre>  [ ]
</pre>

<p>The above will create an empty quote and leave a pointer to it on the
stack. You can attach a name to a quote with <b>is</b>:
</p>
<pre>  [ ] is empty-quote
</pre>

<p>Names can include any characters, other than space, tab, cr, or lf (enter
key). (<i>There are other forms of <b>is</b>, but this is the most common
one; the others will be discussed later</i>).</p>
