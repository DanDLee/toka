<h1>&nbsp;Commenting Code</h1>


<p>It is generally a good idea to comment your code. Comments will make it
much easier to remember what's going on, can help you locate bugs, and
also be of significant benefit to others who may work on your code at a
later time.
</p>
<p>Toka provides two ways to comment your code.
</p>
<h4>In The Listener</h4>

<p>At the listener (the top level interpreter), you can use <b>#!</b>
comments. These are comments that start with <b>#!</b> and end at the end
of the current line. For example, I often start my programs with a short
information block such as the following:
</p>
<pre>  #! ---------------------------------------------------------------
  #! A small HTTP server for Toka
  #!
  #! Developed by:
  #!  Charles R. Childers
  #!  erider
  #!
  #! ---------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>This style comment works well for blocks, and thus can be very useful at
the start of a function:
</p>
<pre>  #! ---------------------------------------------------------------
  #! get-request
  #! This reads a client request of up to 1k into the buffer. The
  #! number of bytes read is returned.
  #! ---------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p><b>#!</b> comments can <i>not be used inside quotes</i>.
</p>
<h4>Inside Quotes</h4>

<p>Inside a quote, you can use <b>( ... )</b> comments. These start with a
<b>(</b> and end when <b>)</b> is encountered. Unlike <b>#!</b> comments,
these can span multiple lines and be used inside of quotes. An example:
</p>
<pre>  [ 
    connection     (  -a )
    @              ( a-n )
    pClose         ( n-  )
  ] is end-connection
</pre>

<p>In this example, each stack action is mapped out using a <i>stack
comment</i>. This is helpful when learning to use Toka, as it makes it
easier to visualize the stack at each step.</p>
