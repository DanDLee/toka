<h1>&nbsp;Sandbox</h1>


<p>This is place to experiment with Notebook's way of marking up text.
Edit this page to see how you type things; then save it to see what it looks
like when you're browsing.
</p>
<h2>You Can Have Section Headers</h2>


<ul>
<li> You can have bulleted lists.
<li> You can type <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and <tt>monospace</tt> text,
	or any combination.
<li> You can have <font face="serif" size="+2"><b>inline header text</b></font>.
<li> You can have <font face="sans-serif" size="-2">very small</font> text.
<li> You can <s>strike things out</s>.

</li>
You can simply indent a paragraph without adding a bullet.

</ul>

<p>Paragraphs end with the first blank line, bullet item, or indented line.
No matter how many lines long a paragraph is, Notebook will wrap it for
display so that it looks nice.
</p>
<pre> If you leave a space character at the beginning of a paragraph, the whole
 paragraph is "Preformatted".  That means that it's displayed in a monospace
 font, exactly as is.  It's conventional to put whitespace at the beginning of
 every line of a preformatted paragraph, but that's not necessary.
</pre>

<p>Preformatted text is useful for typing in tables and things like that.</p>
