<h1>&nbsp;Constants</h1>


<p>For data that does not change, a <i>constant</i> can be created as
follows:
</p>
<pre>  100 is-data OneHundred
  " /home/crc/htdocs/" is-data docroot
</pre>

<p>The first example takes the number 100, and assigns a name (OneHundred)
to it. The name can now be used as a symbolic constant at the listener or
inside a quote. The second example creates a named pointer to a string,
which can also be used at the listener or inside quotes.
</p>
<p>The use of constants is encouraged as it makes code easier to read and
maintain. They have minimal impact on performance, and are significantly
faster to use than variables.</p>
