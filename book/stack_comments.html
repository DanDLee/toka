<h1>&nbsp;Stack Comments</h1>


<p>Stack comments provide a way to specify the action of a quote as it
relates to the stack. It's normally a good idea to keep a list of words
with their description and stack comments on hand if they are not part of
the source.
</p>
<p>A typical stack comment will resemble the following:
</p>
<pre>  ( abc-d )
</pre>

<p>The dash shows the before/after split. In the example above, the quote
takes three elements from the stack (a, b, and c) and leaves a new one
(d). 
</p>
<p>Words that parse use <i>"</i> as a symbol to denote this. For example:
</p>
<pre>  ( a"-b )
</pre>

<p>This is a stack comment for a word that takes a string (a), parses the
input until a specified symbol is encountered, and returns a new string
(b).
</p>
<p>The exact meaning of the symbols is up to you. Generally in a
description, you can explain them better, but the stack comment form is
just a general overview.
</p>
<p><i>When you are learning Toka, it may be helpful to write out stack
comments for each step in a quote. This can help you keep track of the
stack and become more comfortable using it.</i></p>
