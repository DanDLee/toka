Toka is a programming language that draws on my experiences with a variety
of languages. It's still experimental, so things sometimes change significantly
with little to no warning. Overall it does work suprising well though.

The language has been influenced by my experiences with RetroForth, HelFORTH, 
Factor, and other languages. In most respects it shows a strong bias towards
Forth. It does have some extra things (quotes, garbage collection, etc) that
make programming easier for me.

The language is documented using a tool called Notebook. (Get a copy from
http://notebook.wjduquette.com/). Take a look at the "toka.nbk" in the "doc"
directory. An HTML formatted version of this documentation is provided as
"toka.html" in the "doc" directory.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

1) Run "make"

   This should build the 'toka' binary. You may get some compiler warnings,
   depending on the version of GCC you use.

   You can run Toka without installing it. Keep the 'toka' and 'bootstrap.toka'
   files in the same directory and run "./toka" to start it.

2) Run "sudo make install"

   This will put 'toka' into /usr/bin, and create /usr/share/toka, where
   'bootstrap.toka' will be placed.

   Installation automatically runs the test suite and generates a 'test.log';
   if any errors show up in this, please let us know!
