Toka is a small programming language. It is considered experimental, and 
may change without warning.

The language has been influenced by my experiences with RetroForth, 
HelFORTH, Factor, and other languages. I find it fun and rewarding to 
work on, even if it's not as practical as other languages.

The core language is described in GLOSSARY. A reference to the bootstrap 
is provided online. 

Homepage: http://code.google.com/p/toka

At the homepage is information on how to obtain the latest source via 
Subversion, wiki pages documenting various parts of the language, and a 
bug tracker. 

You may also want to get the library. This is provided as a separate 
project at:  http://code.google.com/p/toka-library

The library adds several loadable modules that improve support for strings, 
debugging, add basic socket support, and more. The library is tested on 
Linux and BSD systems. In addition, it has experimental Windows support 
(via Cygwin).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have the rebuild tool (http://code.google.com/p/rebuild) and would
rather not use make, you can build and install Toka by doing:

cd source
rebuild toka
cp toka /usr/bin
cd ..
mkdir -p /usr/share/toka
cp bootstrap.toka /usr/share/toka

You will probably need to be root, at least initially. Once installed, you
can change the owner/permissions to allow a normal account to update it.

Documentation is now being provided in Notebook format. Notebook is a
small hypertext editor. You can get it at http://notebook.wjduquette.com/

HTML formatted documentation can be found at http://charleschilders.com/toka
It is synced with the Notebook documentation whenever anything significant
is added.
