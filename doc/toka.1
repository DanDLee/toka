.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Toka is a small language with many similarities to Forth. It
was designed to be be easily learned, extended, and used. In
addition, it acts a research project, and thus has an evolving
set of features. 
.PP
It has a minimal form of garbage collection, decompiler, makes
use of threaded code, and provides a small number of carefully
selected primitives. In addition, it also features a standard
bootstrap module (loaded on startup), which greatly expands the
core primitives into a useful language.
