<h1>&nbsp;Tutorial</h1>


<p>This is a series of lessons on the Toka programming language. It's based
directly on the tutorials for Forth and Open Firmware that were written
by Mitch Bradley for the OLPC project.
</p>
<p>The original lessons can be found at http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Forth_Lessons
</p>
<p>I have made as few changes as possible. I truely hope this proves
beneficial to all those who may wish to learn to use Toka.
