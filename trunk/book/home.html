<p>Hello, and welcome to Toka!
</p>
<p>Toka is a small programming language. It is considered experimental, and 
may change without warning.
</p>
<p>The language has been influenced by my experiences with RetroForth, 
HelFORTH, Factor, and other languages. I find it fun and rewarding to 
work on, even if it's not as practical as other languages.
