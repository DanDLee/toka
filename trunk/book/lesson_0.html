<h1>&nbsp;Lesson 0</h1>


<h2>Why Bother?</h2>

<p>Toka is weird compared to most popular computer languages. Until you
learn how, it is hard to read because it is not based on the syntax of
algebraic expressions.
</p>
<p>But it is worth learning because a running Toka system gives you an
extraordinary degree of low-level control over the system. Unlike most
other programming environments that put up walls to hide or block access
to "unauthorized" things, Toka makes it easy to get at anything, at any
level from low to high.
</p>
<h2>Toka Syntax</h2>

<p>Here is syntactically-valid line of Toka code: 
</p>
<pre> this is a test 123 456
</pre>

<p>Don't try to guess what it does; in fact it doesn't necessarily actually
work, because some of the symbols might not be defined. But it is
syntactically valid. It consists of 6 words, "this" "is" "a" "test" "123"
"456". Words are separated by white space - spaces, tabs, and newlines.
In most cases, spaces and newlines are the same.
</p>
<p>Another syntactically valid line: 
</p>
<pre> asdf  foo  jello  @W#$%^,T/%$  1a2qw2   gibbet
</pre>

<p>That's 6 words. One of them is pretty strange, consisting mostly of
punctuation, but it is a word nevertheless. Any string of printing
characters is a word. Toka limits word names to 255 characters.
</p>
<h2>Left to Right Execution</h2>

<p>The Toka interpreter is very simple. It parses the next word (i.e. it
skips whitespace, then collects characters until it sees another
whitespace character) and executes it.
</p>
<p>That is it in a nutshell. So if you are trying to understand a Toka
program in detail, you have to look at each word in turn and work out
what it does. That sounds simple, but it will trip you up if you insist
on looking for algebra. Just go left to right, one word at a time.
</p>
<p>With practice, you will learn enough of the Toka vocabulary (the meanings
of standard words) so that you can see what is going on at a glance,
without having to puzzle out each individual word. It is just like
learning to read - it is tedious until you get the basic vocabulary down,
then it is easy. 
</p>
