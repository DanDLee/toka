#! Sort an array (or list) of integers in ascending numerical order. Use 
#! a sorting facility provided by the language/library if possible.

#! This can be done by using the bubble sort library: 

needs bsort
arrayname number_elements bsort

#! See the Toka entry on Bubble_Sort for a full example.
