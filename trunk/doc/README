Toka is a small programming language. It is considered experimental, and may change without warning.

The language has been influenced by my experiences with RetroForth, HelFORTH, Factor, and other 
languages. I find it fun and rewarding to work on, even if it's not as practical as other languages.

The core language is described in GLOSSARY. A reference to the bootstrap is provided online.

At the homepage is information on how to obtain the latest source via Subversion, wiki pages documenting
various parts of the language, and a bug tracker. 

You may also want to get the library. This is provided as a separate project at:
http://code.google.com/p/toka-library

The library adds several loadable modules that improve support for strings, debugging, add basic socket
support, and more. The library is tested on Linux and BSD systems. In addition, it has experimental 
Windows support (via Cygwin).
