#! Get the Address
#! 
#! The default behaviour of a data element in Toka is to return 
#! its address. This makes obtaining the address trivial: 
variable foo
foo .

#! Set the Address
#!
#! You can manually assign a name to any memory address (or other 
#! number), but you should make sure it's part of allocated memory 
#! first. 
 hex abcdef is-data foo
 foo .
