#! In this task, the job is to verify the size of a file called "input.txt" 
#! for a file in the current working directory and another one in the file 
#! system root.

#! A trivial method follows: 
 " input.txt"  "R" file.open dup file.size . file.close
 " /input.txt" "R" file.open dup file.size . file.close

#! A better method would be to define a new function that actually checks whether the file exists: 
 [ "R" file.open
   dup 0 <> [ dup file.size . file.close ] ifTrue
   drop
 ] is display-size
 
 " input.txt"  display-size
 " /input.txt" display-size
