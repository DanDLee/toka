#! Demonstrate all ways to include text in a language source file which is

#! Toka provides a number of ways to add comment text. As with everything in Toka, 
#! comment characters are actually words which control the compiler. 

 #! The backslash skips everything else on the line
 ( The left paren skips everything up to the next right paren)

#! The paren comments are normally used for "stack effect" notation: 

 [ ( a b -- c ) ... ] is myword

#! This comment means "myword takes two cells on the stack and leaves one". Sometimes, 
#! stack effect comment names give clues about the word's function: 

 [ ( a b -- a+b ) + ] is add'em
