#! Toka has no data types, and therefore no enumeration type. The forth approach 
#! of creating a defining word such as the following will work: 

[ ( n "name" -- n+1 )
  dup is-data 1 + ] is enum


#! This word defines a new constant of the value specified and returns the next 
#! value in sequence. It would be used like this: 

0 enum apple  enum banana  enum cherry drop
