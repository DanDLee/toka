#! Toka has no direct support for 2D arrays, but they can be created 
#! and operated on in a manner similar to normal arrays using the 
#! following functions. 

[ ( x y -- address )
  cells malloc >r
  dup cells >r
  [ r> r> r> 2dup >r >r swap malloc swap i swap array.put >r ] iterate
r> r> nip
] is 2D-array

[ ( a b address -- value )
  array.get array.get
] is 2D-array.get
[ ( value a b address -- )
  array.get array.put
] is 2D-array.put

#! And a short test: 

5 5 2D-array >r             #! Create an array and save the pointer to it
10 2 3 r@ 2D-array.put    #! Set element 2,3 to 10
2 3 r@ 2D-array.get       #! Get the element at 2,3
r> drop                     #! Discard the pointer to the array
