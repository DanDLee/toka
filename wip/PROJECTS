Current Projects
==============================================
This directory contains a variety of things I
am working on, but which are not complete 
enough to merge into the main sections of the
Toka codebase and library.

Not all of these will prove useful, and many
may be of very limited scope for people other
than myself.
==============================================


= tokadoc =
A set of scripts that can be used to document
the basic function information for programs 
written in various languages. Current targets 
are C or Toka.

Currently there is a varient of the simple 
tokadoc-c script, which looks for comments 
taking one of the following forms:

  #! |F| ........description...............

  #! |G| name ( stack ) description........

These are put into TOKA_FUNCTIONS (for |F|) and
TOKA_GLOSSARY (for |G|).

In the future it will be possible to build helpdb
sources from the GLOSSARY file.
==============================================

= enum =
This adds support for basic enumerated constants.

Example:

  1 enum| a b c d e |
  213 enum| f g h i |

It may be added to the bootstrap, or moved into a
new or existing library module in the future.
==============================================

= build_pkg =
This is the start of a set of scripts and tools
to automate the building of .deb, .rpm, and other
packaging formats for the nightly builds of Toka.

It is no where near complete at this time.
==============================================

= http-listener =
This is an ambitious project in which I hope to
develop a web-based frontend to Toka.

At present the first stage is mostly done. This
is a documentation browser, allowing you to view
the documentation for any word in the Toka core
and bootstrap. Work on adding related entries and 
examples is ongoing.

Later I hope to allow use of it to extend and
document a running Toka instance, with some
debugging facilities.
==============================================

= server =

This is a minimal framework for building server
applications. It'll become the basis for revised
http servers, echo server, and http listener
someday.
